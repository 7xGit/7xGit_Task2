## Overview
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game! This C++ application challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number based on the chosen difficulty level.

  - Hard: Guess a number between 1-100 (10 attempts).
  
- **Random Number Generation**: A random number is generated based on the selected difficulty level.
  
- **Guess Feedback**:
  - "Too low" if the guess is below the secret number.
  - "Too high" if the guess is above the secret number.
  - "Congratulations" if the guess is correct.
